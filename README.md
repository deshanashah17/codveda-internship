Codveda Internship — Data Analysis Tasks

About  
This repository contains internship tasks completed at Codveda Technologies under the Data Analysis domain.  
The work is divided into three levels — Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced — with one selected task from each level.

Level 1 (Basic) — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset  

Dataset: Iris dataset  
Objective: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the dataset.  

Steps Performed:  
1. Loaded dataset using Pandas.  
2. Inspected data — shape, column names, and summary statistics.  
3. Data cleaning — removed duplicates and checked for missing values.  
4. Visualizations:  
   - Histograms for distribution  
   - Boxplots for outlier detection  
   - Scatter plots for feature relationships  
   - Correlation heatmap for feature dependencies  
5. Saved cleaned dataset for future use.  

Files in this Task:  
- Level1_EDA_Iris.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing Python code and visualizations.  
- iris_cleaned.csv — Cleaned dataset without duplicates.

Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python 3  
- Pandas — Data manipulation  
- Matplotlib — Visualizations  
- Seaborn — Statistical plots  
- Jupyter Notebook — Development environment

Internship Workflow  
1. Perform one task from each difficulty level (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced).  
2. Document each task in a separate Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Maintain a clean and well-documented GitHub repository.
